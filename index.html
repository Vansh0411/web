    <h2> Cutting: </h2>
<p> Cutting is a term used by body builders to describe a period in their workout and diet cycle in which they try to "cut"(lose) extra fat and weight by changing their diets from high calorie meals intolower calorie and lower fat meals in order to meet a caloric defecit. </p>
    <h2> Bulking: </h2>
<p> Bulking is when you try to gain as much weight as possible in order to get bigger and "bulk" yourself up. Many people accomplish this by eating large unhealthy amounts of food so that they stay in a caloric surplus in order to put on more pounds. More seasoned body builders try to "eat clean" which means that they eat healthy foods while maintaining a caloric surplus rather than eating a load of unhealthy foods. </p> 
    <h2> Body recomposition: </h2>
<p> Body recomposition is when you try to bulk and cut at the same time. What this means is that you try to gain weight but only in muscle mass and at the same time you cut fat. Body recomposition is very difficult to schieve because it is hard to find a diet that allows you to gain weight while also losing fat. Most diets that allow for this to work ask for a large intake of protein and not much of anything else. </p>
